 Revision list

 version 001 Release for Spartan3e starter kit.
********************************************************************************
 NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE

 This source code is a representation of both Frogger and Scramble hardware.
 There are some minor differences in the boards.

 in scramble_top.vhd there is a constant :

   constant I_HWSEL_FROGGER  : boolean := FALSE;

 set this to FALSE for Scramble and TRUE for Frogger otherwise it won't work !

 NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
********************************************************************************
     Note :

     Switch3 is coin1   (Switch up and then down)
     Switch2 is Start1     "
     Switch1 is Shoot/bomb "
     Switch0 is used to switch between NTSC and VGA (31K). Up (on) is VGA
     and LED0 will come on.

     The push button on the rotary control is used for reset.

     Push buttons left,right up and down are wired to Player1 and Player2
     controls.

     Not great control mapping but enough to play with. I expect users to
     remap the controls to expansion connectors of their choice.

 version 001 Initial release


 The following scripts will create a directory called 'build', copy the source
 files, run the sythesizer and Xilinx place and route tools.

 Assuming the Xilinx tools are installed and working, expand the distribution
 zip file (maintaining directory structure).

 Fire up a command prompt and navigate to the directory.

 run :

 Build_roms_scramble.bat or
 Build_roms_frogger.bat
		- this will convert the files in the Roms directory to VHDL
		  files (also in the Roms directory). These may then be used
		  if you wish to simulate the design. You will need to put the
		  original ROM images in
		  roms\stern_scramble or
		  roms\sega_frogger

		 I am note sure if other varients of ROMs will work.

 then :

 Build_xst.bat - Xilinx build script using Xilinx WebPak

 if you add a /xil switch, the script will not run the synthesizer, just the
 place and route tools. You will be left with a .bit file in the Build directory
 you can use to program a chip. Remember to modify the .ucf file for your
 pinout.


 Additional Notes :

   Button shorts input to ground when pressed
   external pull ups of 1k are recommended.

Audio out :

   This DAC requires an external RC low-pass filter:

   audio_o 0---XXXXX---+---0 analog audio
		3k3    |
		      === 4n7
		       |
		      GND


 Video Out :

   Video out DAC's. Values here give 0.7 Volt peek video output.

   Use the following resistors for Video DACs :

   video_out(3) 510
   video_out(2) 1k
   video_out(1) 2k2
   video_out(0) 3k9

  See the WWW.FPGAARCADE.COM website for details on how to modify the Spartan3e starter kit board.

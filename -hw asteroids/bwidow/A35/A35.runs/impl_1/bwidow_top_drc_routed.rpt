CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 pm/u_bwidow/myavg/memory_addr_reg_rep has an input control pin pm/u_bwidow/myavg/memory_addr_reg_rep/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: pm/u_bwidow/myavg/memory_addr_reg[13]_0[10]) which is driven by a register (pm/u_bwidow/cpu/BAH_reg[2]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-1840#12 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 pm/u_bwidow/myavg/memory_addr_reg_rep__2 has an input control pin pm/u_bwidow/myavg/memory_addr_reg_rep__2/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: pm/u_bwidow/myavg/memory_addr_reg[13]_0[10]) which is driven by a register (pm/u_bwidow/cpu/BAH_reg[5]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
